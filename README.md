# Compounding Savings

A simple web app that I made to learn React. 

While there are hundreds of other compounding interest calculators online, they all have a very bad UI.

This was my attempt at creating a better version of these calculators that allow users to see how much money will compound as a result of them not buying certain things like coffee.
